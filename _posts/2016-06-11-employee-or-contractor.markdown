Employee or Contractor?

Last year I completed 8 years of experience in software development, working in a liberal multinational company, stable job, nice colleagues and good salary.

This is a kind of life that a father of 2 little kids should be happy about it, right? Not really. There is something that I really value about: Freedom. I think it is one of the best things that we can have in the professional life.

I like to decide where to work, when to work and how to work. I want to have more time with my family (no commutes). I want to be paid fairly. These things are very hard to achieve when you work in a normal office. This is why I decided to quit and work remotely as a contractor for others companies.

Iâ€™ve already heard about TopTal before, but now I decided to apply to it because it totally matches with the moment I am living right now. They have a rigorous process to make that only elite contractors will be hired. I think it explains why only 3% of them make it.

To summarize, I think I am committed to join Toptal because it is clearly what I am looking for. I want to have freedom, to work with the best people, to have good clients, and I think Toptal can provide it to me.
